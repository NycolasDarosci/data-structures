Array -> list of data elements. Simpliest data structure
- [x]  Four operations of data structures (Array)
    ```
    READ
    SEARCH
    INSERTION
    DELETION
    
    Array-Based Set INSERTION is different:
    requires a SEARCH first before insert something
    to see if there's a a duplicate value
    ```
- [x]  Linear Search -> O(n)
- [x]  Binary Search -> O(log n)
- [ ]  Big O
    - [x] O(N)
    - [x] O(1)
    - [x] O(log N)
    - [x] O(n²) -> consider a slow algorithm
- [ ] Sort algorithms
    - [x]  Bubble Sort -> O(n²)
    - [x]  Selection Sort -> O(n²)
    - [ ]  Insertion Sort -> 
- [ ]  Review the above items
